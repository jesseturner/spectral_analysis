### Spectral Analysis

Tools for comparing the infrared spectra of low clouds and clear sky. 

Data sources: 
* JPSS instruments VIIRS, CrIS, and Day-Night Band
* Numerical weather prediction model GFS
* Simulated GeoXO sounder (GXS)
* Radiosonde measurements

Methods: 
* MODTRAN radiative transfer simulation (available on jpss-cloud6 machine)
* creation of broadbands from narrow bands using spectral response functions
