# spectral_analysis

*In process: Converting the CrIS and ASSIST scripts into functions in utils, then deleting scripts.* 

Instructions: 
* Download the CrIS data with `CrIS_data.py`
* Create the CrIS spectrum with `CrIS_plot.py`
* Create a spatial image of the scene with `CrIS_plot_spatial.py`

Due to low spatial resolution, ran ABI imagery:
* Ran `FLC_Workspace_3/satellite_image.ipynb` and copied result to local `ABI_figures` directory
